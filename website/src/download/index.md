# Installation

Using the [installer](/download/#using-installer) is the fastest and most reliable way to install KeyTik because it can also install the requirements. However, sometimes Windows may label the installer as malware. For that reason, we also provide a [manual](/download/#manual-installation) installation option.

## Using Installer

1. Download KeyTik installer using [download button](/download/#download) above.
2. Go to the download file and run it.
3. Follow the instruction.
4. Done.

## Manual Installation

This is the traditional way to set up KeyTik without using an installer. Instead of a full installation, you simply download the source files and place them anywhere on your machine to run the software.
1. Download and install requirements

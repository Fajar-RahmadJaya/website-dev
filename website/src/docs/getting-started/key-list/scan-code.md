# Scan Code

KeyTik uses AutoHotkey, so any key supported by AutoHotkey is also supported by KeyTik.

KeyTik supports remapping keys via SC. Scan codes (SC) are hardware-specific codes that indicate key location. This is useful if you can't find your key. SC will remaps the key at a specific location instead of a specific key. The number of supported scan codes depends on your keyboard.

You can get your keyboard scan code with checking the "Use Scan Code" button when setting up remap, then use "Select Button" to start listening to your input. Then just press the key that you want to remap and KeyTik will automatically take the scan code of the pressed key. When "Use Scan Code" checkbox not checked, "Select" button will take key string instead like Tab Shift etc.

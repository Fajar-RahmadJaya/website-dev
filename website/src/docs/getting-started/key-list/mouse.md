KeyTik supports a wide range of mouse keys, even unusual ones. There are around 9 mouse specific keys.

Below is a list of Mouse-specific keys that KeyTik supports. Single keys like symbols or letters are listed separately. This list is adapted from the [AutoHotkey Website](https://autohotkey.com).

|--------|----------------------------------------------------|

|Right Button|Secondary mouse button. Which physical button this corresponds to depends on system settings; by default it is the right button.|
|Middle Button|Middle or wheel mouse button.|
|XButton1|4th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Back.|
|XButton2|5th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Forward.|
|Wheel Up|Turn the wheel downward (toward you).|

|Wheel Left|Scroll to the left. These can be used as hotkeys with some (but not all) mice which have a second wheel or support tilting the wheel to either side. In some cases, software bundled with the mouse must instead be used to control this feature. Regardless of the particular mouse.|
|Wheel Right|Scroll to the rigt. These can be used as hotkeys with some (but not all) mice which have a second wheel or support tilting the wheel to either side. In some cases, software bundled with the mouse must instead be used to control this feature. Regardless of the particular mouse.|

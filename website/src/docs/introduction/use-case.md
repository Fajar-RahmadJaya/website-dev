# Use Case Example

Here is example how you can use KeyTik and utilize each features.

## Advance Keyboard Remapping
KeyTik not only able to remap just one key to another but also multiple remap format you can use. This can make you have more control over your keyboard or mouse. Normal keyboard and mouse sometimes is boring and not efficient to use. With KeyTik, you can made your keyboard or mouse more useful, unique and can behave as you like it.

You can even make your own keyboard layout easily with KeyTik, that just how much powerful KeyTik is. This can be achieved with remapping every single key based on your layout. You can even made your layout not just pressing a key but also another command such as pressing shortcut or automation. Imagine having a special key on your keyboard that can do auto click. That would be cool right?

What remap KeyTik can do is single key, multiple key or shortcut, text, KeyTik built in automation tool (Auto clicker, screen clicker, multiple files opener, screen coordinate finder). Not only a single key, you can also use shortcut or key combination to simulate remap key. For example, pressing (Ctrl + 1) will press F1. You can use this if your keyboard doesn't has specific key and you want to make add it on your keyboard.

Remap key to text can be used when you have a repetitive text or sentence that you always use. For example greeting (Good morning, Thank you for coming and more) and you don't want to type it every single time. Then you can remap your key or use shortcut to automatically type it when you need to use the text.

## Utilize Second Keyboard
If you have unused keyboard and it still working, why not use it to increase your productivity. Even more, you can buy mini keyboard for better comfort and tidiness. With the second keyboard, you can remap it's key to something else without affecting main keyboard. To do this, you just need to use assign profile on specific device features. Simply choose which one your keyboard ID and assign automation tool or remap to it. Here is what you can remap your second keyboard with:

- Automation Tool
   - You can assign automation tool on your second keyboard whether using key combination or just a single key. For better use, we recommend using only one key for it. Imagine having a key that can do auto clicking, screen clicking, automatic files opening, automatic screen coordinate finding in just a single press. On top of that, KeyTik built in automation tool is highly customizable. This mean You can assign for more that 4 key with automation tool customization. For example, one key will opening required files for certain task and the other key will opening required files for another task. You can also do this this another automation tool.
- Key Remap
   - There are various key in the world. And your keyboard might be not have what key you need to use. In that case, you can remap your second keyboard key to your missing key.
   - Another use case is to use remap your second key not only to another key but also a text. When you work on marketing side or similar, sometimes you have the same phrase used multiple time. This can take a lot of time to type. Of course you can also copy and paste it but obviously you need to copy it beforehand to paste the phrase. In that case, you can remap you second keyboard to type the phrase in a single key and single press. Of course it can be used in another task required to use the same phrase multiple time beside marketing.
- Command remap
   - There are various shortcut to simulate command out there. What we mean by command is like copy, paste, redo, undo etc. Pressing 2 key rapidly can make our finger sore. Then why don't remap a key to simulate this shortcut. This way, instead of pressing 2 key, we can just simply press a single key. This can also work for shortcut with more that 2 key press. Utilizing second keyboard is a way to go for this task. This way there is no key we sacrifice on main keyboard and use the key on second keyboard instead.

## Open Programs or Files Automatically
When we have work that require to open multiple files every time we work on it, sometimes it can be frustrating to open it one-by-one. But with KeyTik you can automate this task easily with various customization on how it will behave. You can use KeyTik built in multiple files opener to do this. Here is how you can customize it:

- Using shortcuts to open the files or program.
  - You can assign shortcut on the multiple files opener profiles then run the profiles on startup. This way, whenever you want to work and need to open the files or programs, you just need to press shortcut to do it. You can assign shortcut with a single key (Example: F1), key combination (Example: ctrl+1), or multiple key (Example: alt+ctrl+1+etc).
- Open multiple files or program whenever device start.
   - You can make multiple files or programs to automatically open whenever you open your device. This way, you can directly work on your assignment after opening your device. To do this, simply just don't assign any shortcut to multiple files opener profile, then run it on startup.

## Auto Clicker
Auto clicker is an automation tool to press keys simultaneously. KeyTik also has a built-in auto clicker. Other auto clickers usually can only press left click, but with KeyTik you can press various keys and are not limited to only left click. On top of that, you can customize the auto clicker more, such as the interval between clicks and the key to activate it. KeyTik's auto clicker works when you hold the key and stops when you release it. This is also different from other auto clickers. Maybe in the future, we will also add an option to hold or just press to activate or stop the auto clicker.

**Note: Make sure to follow the rules and be responsible when using auto clicker, whether it's in game or others.**

## Screen Clicker
Similar to auto clicker, screen clicker is also a type of automation to auto click some keys. The difference is screen clicker doesn't just simulate clicks on the cursor. Instead, you can specify where to click the key. For example, some downloads sometimes have a bunch of redirects and waiting times. Using screen clicker, you can automate this process by specifying each download button coordinate and putting an interval between them if needed.

Screen clicker can automate almost all clicking tasks you have. As long as what it needs is just clicking, screen clicker should be able to do the job. For now, KeyTik only has coordinate and interval customization. But we plan to include other customizations such as clicking on specific strings, images, intervals between each click, conditions for each click (Example: Do action 4 when action 3 is done, if action 3 fails, restart to action 2) for more control. But these additions are still in planning and may or may not be implemented according to conditions.

**Note: Make sure to follow the rules and be responsible when using screen clicker, whether it's in game or others.**

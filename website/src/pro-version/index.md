## Why You Choose Pro Version
- Support the developer.
- More feature than the regular version.
- Get early access for the upcoming KeyTik update.
- Expect an evolving software. My goal for KeyTik Pro is software that covers or combines many tools at once.

## Pro Version Feature
### Keyboard Remapper
- Remap on specific devices and programs.
- Original key (key that you press will simulate remap key): Single key, multiple key or shortcuts, double click.
- Remap key (Key that will be shown or simulated when you press original key): Single key, multiple key or shortcuts, hold key, text (Simulate typing such as 'Hello').
- Example: Pressing the left shift will hold left click, with the interval chosen by user. Pressing Ctrl+H will type Hello. And more.
- Multiple remap settings or profiles: You can create your remap settings as much as you want and activate or deactivate them separately.

### Auto Clicker
- Shortcuts: What key to press to activate auto clicker.
- Click Interval: Interval between each click.
- Key to press (Mouse Button): What key to press for auto clicker (not just left click or right click but more keys on the keyboard such as all alphabet, shift, ctrl and more)
- Click type: How will the key press behave. Single click, Double Click, Hold.
- Click Location: Where click will pressed. Follow cursor, clicking on cursor. Fixed position, position on screen.
- Click Repeat: How long does the click will pressed. Infinite clicks, stop until it deactivates by shortcuts. Fixed count, click as much as the count specified.

### Easy Always on Top
- Make the window where cursor is located always on top with a shortcut or click.
- Shortcuts or clicks can be changed by user.

### Window Size Changer
- Change window size with shortcut or click.
- How window will be changed: Full, horizontal half top, horizontal half bottom, vertical half left, vertical half right, quarter top left, quarter top right, quarter bottom left, quarter bottom right, original position.
- The window size will be changed alternately with each click.
- Shortcuts or clicks can be changed by user.

### Multiple Files Opener
- Using shortcuts to open multiple files.
- You can specify what files to open yourself without limit.

### Multi Copy Paste
- Make multiple shortcuts for copy and paste.
- Each shortcuts have different room to save copied text.
- For example: First copy shortcuts copied "text1" and second copy shortcuts copied "text2". Pressing second paste shortcuts will paste "text2" and pressing first shortcuts will paste "text1".

### General Features
This is a feature that all profile has. Profile is what setting you create whether it's for auto clicker, keyboard remap or anything I have described earlier.
- Run on startup for individual profiles.
- Managed profiles: Run, exit, delete, edit, copy each profile.
- Assign profiles on specific devices: Make profiles only work on specific keyboards or mouse.
